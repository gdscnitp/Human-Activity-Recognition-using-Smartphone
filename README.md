# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone

## Introduction:-

This project senses the human activity with the help of a app installed in the smart phone which uses ML to predict from the data collected from sensors present in phone. This Project is handled by DSC ML Team of NIT Patna

## Which Sensors we use to get the data:-

1. Accelerometer

2. Gyroscope

## How it works?

Once we collect the data we will be preprocessing the data and train it using LSTM or further more advanced models. Then finally we would be predicting the activity.

## Tasks Involved:-

1. Firstly we need to make a android app and integrate with firebase for collecting the data
2. Then we need to preprocess the data
3. Create a ML Model
4. Need to deploy the model in Mobile
5. Make it avalaible in Playstore
